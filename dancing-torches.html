      <h1>Dancing Torches</h1>
      <div class="story">
            <p>Once upon a time, little torches danced in the darkness, lighting those around. They are but a little bright, yet its tiny spark brightened the hopes and dreams to come. They danced without tiresome, the more and more they danced, the more happiness came to ground. They have yet to realize those who had dimmed nor those that had kindled. Time would have a smile on its face welcoming it to the world.</p>
            <br><p>At first, there were so many of them, torches that danced inside the dark as if the whole world is dancing in tiny sparkles. As time goes, the amount of torches filled the room. They burn to sight faster than those that went to the deep abyss. As time would tell, the torches started to dance with their own formations but not yet realized and not yet clear. </p>
            <br><p>From time to time the torches would dance as if exited, and time to time the torches slowed down as if tired, sad, and the dark space would sometime truly feel lonely. Time would watch over these tiny torches but with no emotion and without a care, it would just let them dance to the flow of their heart. </p>
            <br><p>One day, something different happened, an enlightenment unlike any other before. The torches started to spark as brilliant as a star, dancing in happiness with many different formations. They became so ever bright that even time started to question what made them dance so ever beautifully.</p>
            <br><p>As time grows older, the torches would go dimmer, again. Once in a while it would sparkle, never as bright as it was before yet always had that beautiful light. That moment, the torches started to form a constant formation. They always seemed like they danced to gain something, to fight. Dancing in a never seen proper way. Still unique to its own even with the same form. In many ways, it just sparkled differently from before, as if how they look at the darkness is now different. Time would not mind, time would just past away.</p>
