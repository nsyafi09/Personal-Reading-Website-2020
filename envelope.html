      <h1>Had I Have One More Envelope to Write</h1>
      <div class="story">
            <p>A nostalgic scent came to mind, an old tale which began to uncover itself to the surface of heart. The old to thrive, not giving to the world, to expect a better tomorrow and to appreciate every day. That old rhyme of feeling would bring me back, just to give you an envelope with a letter inside. Just like it was many years ago.</p>
            <br><p>If time were to just go back to that smiling days, then I would still be writing this letter to you. An old one, revealing my adventures to you, the things I have done, and the people I have met. Just looking at the sky reminded me that we look at the same one. I just hope that you are still looking at it, this beautiful view blessed by the majesty of the world. For just one more time, I would like to give you a letter inside the envelope, one that had not come for many long nights. I would like to repay you for your kindness, your love, everything you have done for me. I want it to give you a tiny smile under this pretty sky, to give you a thank you letter from me to you.</p>
            <br><p>I started writing the things I want to say, so many things came to mind that the paper was written with imaginary ink. Empty, without a word, because a single paper could not explain how much you meant to me. I used the same envelope, the old one that I used to gave you. The envelope brought me an old world that brought me to tears. Reminding me of that nostalgic breeze, I kept writing with the shadow pen, all I know is that I would jump with joy had I meet you once more. As I finished my letter, to give it to you was my purpose. For once, I want to give it by myself. This envelope with a letter inside that took so long, just to come for you.</p>
            <br><p>I took the plane leaving the big city, to an old rural place where we used to play. While the thought of seeing you clouded my emotion. I could not wipe the grin off of my face. In that old town where the many of the young left to search for a larger pond, flowing through a river to the world of sea, leaving it forever. Many things have changed, many new things I have never seen before, yet the feeling was never different. It was the same rhyme of memoirs as the one I felt years ago. The letter I hold for you, inside this old envelope that is meant for you, as if shaking out of patience for it to meet its reader.</p>
            <br><p>I took the train and opened the window. This wind that never gets old startled me, breezy in the face. It reminded me of the time we played, the days we wished the sun would never set. The night where it is cold and you told me to not be scared. As long as the heart moves, the dream and effort would never fade. The encouragement you gave that led me here. I would like to give you one more envelope with a letter inside.</p>
            <br><p>Up on the hill that was once our playground. An unknown surprised sound, calling me was an old woman I though I would never found. She has aged but her souls remains the bound, to this very place she called home. Her smile had never fainted from her face, as if welcoming me to this nostalgic ground. It felt like I was home again.</p>
            <br><p>I took out the letter inside, then she smiled as a reply. She signed her hand, asking me to come to her side. I accompanied her to the backyard, where there lies a stone with name written on. I hold the envelope in my hand tight.</p>
