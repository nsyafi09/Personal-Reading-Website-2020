      <h1>Shallow Light Upon the Sea</h1>
      <div class="story">
            <p>A shallow light upon the sea, the reef was calling out to me, reeled in the thoughts to somewhere it should be, a shallow light for people to see. As the clouds began to scatter, I stood atop the arch only to see a saddened sun, preaching its good bye. For the light in the sky was born to fade, as the time would dare to tell. The night was born anew. The shallow light by the sea had yet to gave up on me.</p>
            <br><p>The darkness began its reign, accompanied by the hopes in form of tiny sparks. The blue ball watched me from afar, spreading lunar light that illuminated the dark. Shallow light upon the sea, guiding my heart to where it should be, started to tease my eyes with ease. As the blueish colors began to move. Colorful as it may be, the view was a gift for us to see.</p>
            <br><p>As the night grows older yet young, the hopes and dreams began to burst. The sign of life began to sprout, a beautiful sky filled with dreams to spread. I was a lonely soul very far from its reach, yet the light came to me. Upon the sea, the reflection turned to reality. If only you could see, you would love this world as it may be.</p>
            <br><p>I took the train and opened the window. This wind that never gets old startled me, breezy in the face. It reminded me of the time we played, the days we wished the sun would never set. The night where it is cold and you told me to not be scared. As long as the heart moves, the dream and effort would never fade. The encouragement you gave that led me here. I would like to give you one more envelope with a letter inside.</p>
            <br><p>Pain, suffering, and sorrow were burrowed deep under the depth of the sea. The darkness crawled out to me, taking its stand to take a speech. It rallied the beauties that hold it dearly. Such memoirs would create happiness without melancholy. Suddenly even the void turned to smile. The liveliness of those who bore the sun, they danced as the wind blew kindly.</p>
            <br><p>Time flew, the night got old, the stories were told. To children, young ones, to the old. They were a catalyst to our kindness. Smiles. Laugh. Joy. All the hollows in life turned to life, lessons to be taught. The tangled web-like flower with its lightly colors began to open its eyes. The Milky Way. Truly reminded of the beauty that was given. All reflected upon the sea. Breaching the depths as a light upon the sea.</p>
