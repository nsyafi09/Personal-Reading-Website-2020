      <div class="story">
            <p>On a certain day in a certain summer, I had just graduated from school. I went back to my village to greet my parents, my time while in the city was finally over I can finally relax for a few moments.</p>
            <p>I came to my room tidied by my mother. Everything was in place, my desk was clean, my books were organized, and my old toys were stuffed in the closet.</p>
            <p>As the nostalgia came to my mind, I had an idea to run over the toys and memories I had left behind. I took them out of my closet, the fond memories of when I was a child. I laugh in bitter and sweetness from my childhood days. It was a happy moment.</p>
            <p>In the back of all the things I used to cherish, a small and old box was there as if it greeted me. I took it out only to see a childish writing above the lid. <em>Do not open!</em></p>
            <p><em>What was it again?</em> I thought. It must have been very long ago. I did not think about it much and opened the lid, it was a sunflower that has already withered. Looking at it I remembered, a small tiny time even before these priceless toys of the past. A memory of me and an old friend of mine.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I was a little kid back in my rural hometown, there were sunflowers inside the forest we used to play. Accompanied by a girl whom I met. I took no interest in playing outside until she suddenly came here on certain summer holiday.</p>
            <p>“Hey you! Let’s play outside!”</p>
            <p>She always was the one to approach me. <em>Come on, don’t be so gloomy</em>. <em>Life is not fun if you don’t enjoy it. Boo¬. </em>She said to me in almost every time we played.</p>
            <p>She was a kind girl, she would play with the gloomy me. She would often share her food whenever she was in a good mood.</p>
            <p>Yet, she was rash, she would punch me for little reasons whenever she was in a bad mood.. She pulled me outside from my humble home. <em>Come on! Come outside</em>. She would lightly punch me and dragged me by the feet sometimes. Which somehow reminded me of how I used to be scared of her back then.</p>
            <p>I followed her wherever she goes, I learned how to be happy, how to enjoy life to the fullest, to go on an adventure, and to enjoy seeing the beautiful sunflowers.</p>
            <p>But then, that girl left.</p>
            <p>“I am moving.”</p>
            <p>She visited me once more before she went away with her family, she gave me something, a box. A closed box only for me to open.</p>
            <p>“I’ll give you this box as a farewell gift. Open that box when you really miss me!”</p>
            <p>“Sure…”</p>
            <p>She went in her car waving her hand with her head outside the window.</p>
            <p>“Bye-bye!”</p>
            <p>Come to think of it, what expression did she make that time?</p>
            <p>After that, I tried not to remember that girl’s farewell gift and hid it in my closet, so that I woudn’t look back and be a stronger person one day.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Inside the box, it was as if stuffed with something. I scratch its surface to find its floor became a lid for a deeper part of it. So, I opened it.</p>
            <p><em>Ooff, there we go</em>. “Long time no see.”</p>
            <p>I startled, <em>gahh?! </em>She came right out of the box.</p>
